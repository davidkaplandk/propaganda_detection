# üõ∞Ô∏è Propaganda Detection

This repository contains resources for prompting LLMs to detect propaganda in social media texts, along with training, validation, and evaluation scripts.  

---

## üìÇ Repository Structure

### `/API Calls`
- Contains scripts and examples of how we prompted the models.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
  - `validation.ipynb` expects a **structured JSON output**.  
  - Scripts should check if LLM outputs are valid JSON.  
  - If invalid, replace with placeholders (e.g., `-1`).  
  - Exactly **200 items** are required for validation.  

**Prompting pipeline overview:**
1. Extract a JSONL line with its prompt.  
2. From the `{"messages": [ ...
      "role": "user",
      "content": <EXTRACT_THIS> ... }]}` field, extract the system prompt.  
3. Replace the tweet text after `"Text:"` with `"Text: {text}"`.  
4. Use this prompt to query the model.

### `/Training and Validation files`
- Contains training/validation data for:  
  - **Our Schema**  
  - **Sahitaj et al.‚Äôs Schema**  
- Split by prompting strategy:  
  - **High only** ‚Üí `*_highonly.jsonl`  
  - **Main + High** ‚Üí `*_high_and_main.jsonl` / `*_high_and_main_updated.jsonl`  

**Example JSONL line:**

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; word-break: break-word;">
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are an expert in propaganda analysis. Always keep in mind that you are only looking for Russian propaganda, not any other type."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "You are an expert in propaganda analysis. Analyze the following text. 
        Always keep in mind that you are only looking for russian propaganda, not any other type of propaganda. Any other            type of propaganda should be ignored and labeled as \"No Propaganda\".

        Text:
        \"@USER HTTPURL all you need to hear about Ukraine propaganda\"

        1. Identify the high-level category that best describes the text.
        
        High-level categories:
        
        1 ‚Äî Patriotic & Catchy Appeals: Techniques like flag-waving or catchy slogans appealing to patriotism or identity.  
        2 ‚Äî Popularity Appeals: Techniques like bandwagon arguments, claiming something is good/true because it‚Äôs popular.  
        3 ‚Äî Deflections & Distractions: Includes whataboutism, repetition, causal oversimplification, or red herrings that               shift focus.  
        4 ‚Äî Emotional & Loaded Persuasion: Techniques using loaded language, fear, name-calling, exaggeration, Nazi                      comparisons, or appeals to authority.  
        5 ‚Äî Argument Manipulations: Techniques like straw man, clich√©s that shut down debate, doubt, or black-and-white                  framing.  
        6 ‚Äî No Propaganda: No relevant Russian propaganda detected.
        
        Now return the labels in a JSON format with the following structure:
        {\"high\": integer}
        
        Follow the json format strictly. Do not add any additional text or explanations. Just use the integers for labeling,         no strings.
        Remember to always return Integers only! Only return one integer that best describes the text. Never return multiple         integers or a list of integers!"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "{\"high\": 5}"
    }
  ]
}
</pre>


 ### `/golden_test_sets`
- Contains gold-standard test sets as pickle files:  
  - `golden_test_set_our_schema.pkl`  
  - `golden_test_set_sahitaj_schema.pkl`  
- Both sets include **low, main, and high-level labels** and can be used with either prompting strategy.  

---

### `validation.ipynb`
- Requires a **JSON file with exactly 200 objects** in the schema defined under `/API Calls`.  
- Must include at least the predicted class name (`"high"` or `"main_and_high"`).  
- Column/JSON key names can be adjusted in the first cell of the notebook.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Sanity check:**  
  - JSON file must have exactly 200 items.  
  - Order must match the corresponding `.jsonl` / `.pkl` files (already aligned).
